# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2) - Teachers' notes

##  Week 8: Modify, and start to rebuild, experiment

### High intensity session

The group and TA reflect on their results, and the feedback received
on their presentation. They discuss what they would have done differently if
they were starting again. They make an assessment of how serious these
shortcomings are to drive the following decision. Should they:

(A) Run a modified version of their first experiment, mainly centered on
addressing the shortcomings of their design or results (e.g. ceiling/floor
effects).

(B) Add a between-subjects condition to their existing study that widens the
investigation to add another factor. Run that second condition in their second
data colleciton phase. 

If choosing B, the TA needs to clarify that adding a condition that this
is OK for teaching purposes but should  be avoided in research you're going
to publish. It introduces a time-of-testing confound. Between-subject
conditions should be finely intermixed. 

Students then revise their protocol, and re-program their experiment in
OpenSesame.

### Low intensity session, and homework

- Submit revised protocol.

- Reprogram experiment.
