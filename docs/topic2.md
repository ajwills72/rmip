## Production Effect

### Overview

Words that are spoken aloud are better remembered than words read silently. The production effect has to do with the question of what makes something "distinctive" and the role that distinctiveness plays in memorability.

## Adaptive Memory

### Overview

Objects relevant to survival are better remembered. Is this evidence that memory is optimised for information that increases evolutionary fitness?

## Metamemory: Judgements of Learning and Font Size

### Overview

Metamemory is our understanding of how our own memory works. Judgments of learning (JOLs) ask people to rate how likely they are to remember information later. JOLs measure naive beliefs about what makes something memorable. People tend to believe that words shown in large fonts will be better remembered than words shown in small fonts. This is an inaccurate belief but it may reveal something important about peoples' insight (or lack thereof) into the capabilities of their own memory.
