# Resarch Methods in Practice (Part 2)

# Insert topic name

## Overview

Provide slides and notes sufficient for another member of academic staff to deliver a 5-minute oral introduction to your topic. Aim to engage and enthuse the students about this topic. The topic should be reasonably broad, e.g. Reasoning, Memory, Learning.

## Insert sub-topic 1 name

### Overview

Provide notes sufficient for a TARA to understand and orally (without slides) present the sub-topic to their groups, and discuss it with them. 

### Reading

Provide exactly three primary journal articles that:

1. **Short**. No more than 4000 words; if longer, indicate partial read up to 4000 words. This will help give students time to understand it fully.

2. **Open**. Available in some form of open-access format, including personal or institutional websites. Teaching open science is a core part of this module.

3. **Easy**. Test: An out-of-area Ph.D. student so be able to fully and quickly pick up what was done and why.

4. **Well powered**: Students will be following this up with an N=25 directional within-subjects hypothesis, followed by an N=25/group directional between-subjects hypothesis. The minimum effect sizes for this are d=.55 for the within-subjects comparison, and d=.75 for the between-subjects comparison. Ensure your papers have something follow-up-able with those effect sizes, and that the papers had sufficiently large sample sizes to accurately estimate that effect size.

5. **Easy to program**: Students have to be able to set this up themselves in Open Sesame quite quickly.
