## Aims

The module aims to support students through a simple research cycle and deliver a 
basic understanding of the research process in psychology before engaging with an 
advanced-research cycle. Statistical analysis techniques are taught in workshops with the aim 
of providing the student with an understanding of the analysis procedures appropriate to a 
range of research designs for testing differences. In addition, the module aims to introduce 
students to issues in conducting psychological research such as research project management.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Develop a simple research question with a high level of guidance from a supervisor and 
translate it into a study.

2. Develop a basic understanding of the importance of ethical issues in research.

3. Understand the basic principles of research management.

4. Run, analyse, evaluate, and report psychological research.

5. Analyse the results of studies using multifactorial ANOVA, and relate them to the relevant 
literature that motivated the work.

6. Execute the statistical methods taught and interpret the output.

7. Communicate the outputs of research through written and oral presentation means.

## Teaching Arrangements

Two two-hour workshops per week, for 12 weeks. Students work in small groups
(about 7) within large workshops of about 100 students and smaller workshops of
about 50 students. Each workshop is run sufficient times to accommodate the
whole cohort. In each week, the first (large) workshop will be staffed by one
lead teacher and four teaching assistants, and the second (small) workshop will
be staffed by two teaching assistants.  The same staff members are present
every week. A brief summary of the provisional schedule for
each week is below; a much more detailed guide may be found on the [Research
Methods in Practice](https://ajwills72.github.io/rmip) website.

Week 2: Define question, outline design and learn about data preprocessing

Week 3: Finalise experimental design

Week 4: Build experiment

Week 5: Upload experiment and begin to learn about ANOVA

Week 6: Collect data and finish learning about ANOVA

Week 7: Finish data collection

Week 8: Analyse data

Week 9: Write a presentation

Week 10: Give presentation

Week 11: Planning a report

Week 12: Critique and support


## Indicative Reading List

The reading materials have been developed in-house and released under a Creative Commons licence, see 
[Research Methods in Practice](https://ajwills72.github.io/rmip) and [Research Methods in R](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/). Primary sources (journal articles) will also form a major part of the reading, but will likely be different for each group. Only open-access journal articles will be used.
